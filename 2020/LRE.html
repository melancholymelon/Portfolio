          <p>Beginning in the fall of 2018, my friend, Jackson Stearns, and I began the development of a kerosene, liquid-oxygen rocket engine. 
            After over 10 iterations, the final engine design was chosen to be a 3D printed inconel engine, which uses the kerosene fuel as a coolant for the combustion chamber.</p>

          <p>
            The engine has printed-in cooling channels in which flow the kerosene fuel for the rocket. 
            The kerosene recieves heat from engine combustion, cooling down the combustion chamber while also improving efficiency by increasing the heat of the incoming fuel.
            To mitigate pressure losses and variation in the engine manifold, the manifold features a tapering area to maintain constant pressure around all of the cooling channels.
          </p> 
          <br>
          <p>
            The engine is to be DMLS printed out of Inconel 718, used for ability to withstand elevated temperature environments, 
            resistance to highly corrosive environments, and its superior strength.
            The inconel engine will be heat treated improve the engine's strength. An FDM variant was printed prior to the DMLS design, which unfortunately failed during the sintering phase.

            After a few years of development, my senior design capstone team was formed to create the fluid feed system for the rocket engine, 
            to be incorporated into a flight vehicle currently being produced by the Aerospace Club at Northeastern. The fluid system consists of two custom made aluminum 6061-T6 flight tanks, solenoid valves, flow piping, and pyrotechnic valves.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I served as the project lead for the group, setting design tasks and driving each design decision. 
            I created the pressure and instrumentation diagram for the system as seen on the right. 
            I also worked with the Northeastern's Environmental Health and Safety Department to design and plan cryogenic flow tests and hydrostatic proof tests that are ongoing. 
            Just recently, I performed hydrostatic proof pressure testing to 1.5 MEOP on our aluminum flight tanks, and some waterflow testing to prove our manifold and cooling channel design.

            Here is a full CAD view of the feed system. The system uses pressurized nitrogen gas to pressurize the two flight tanks, which contain the kerosene and liquid oxygen.
            A composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is used to house the Nitrogen pressurant at a pressure of approximately 4500 psi.
            The outlet pressure out of the N2 tank is then reduced by two pressure regulators, upstream of either fluid tank.
            <br>
            <br>
            After pressurization, the fuel and oxidizer are flowed into the injector of the engine upon the actuation of two pyrotechnically controlled poppet valves.
            Extensive system testing will be performed this Spring to determine if the pressure set points for the regulators achieve the desired pressures and flows required for 
            efficient combustion.
